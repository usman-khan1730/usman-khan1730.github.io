									<h1>PW100G Impeller</h1>
									<h2>Second Year Group Design Project - UCL Mechanical Engineering</h2>
									
									<h3>Overview</h3>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/impeller/pw1000g.png" alt="" /></span>
									<ul>
										<li>Designing and manufacturing an impeller for the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW100 turboprop engine that exhibits superior efficiency and performance.</li><br/>
										<li>A scaled-down impeller was required to be 3D printed out of nylon, which was tested for its performance and then extrapolated to the performance of the real impeller.</li><br/>
										<li>Objectives included incorporating environmentally friendlier manufacturing processes and materials at lower costs, alongside a more reliable impeller design requiring less maintenance and replacement.</li><br/>
										<li>This was a year-long group project, delivering the prototype impeller, dissertation and multiple presentations.</li>
									
									</ul>
									
									<h3>My contributions</h3>

									<ul>
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/impeller/casing.png" alt="" /></span>
										<li>Constraints for the prototype impeller design included:<br/><br/>
											&emsp;&emsp;- Pump casing, assembly and mount dimensions within provided specifications (see right →)<br/>
											&emsp;&emsp;- Impeller operating speed of 2900rpm, with required pressure rise of 0.8 bar<br/>
											&emsp;&emsp;- Number of impeller blades to be between 5 and 10 <br/>
											&emsp;&emsp;- Heights from 0.004-0.02m for inlet blades, and from 0.004-0.08m for outlet blades<br/>
											&emsp;&emsp;- Volute spiral angle of 5.3°, outflow misalignment angle of up to ±1.5°<br/>
										</li><br/>
										
										<li>To create my individual design, I employed analytical calculations to create a mathematical model using MATLAB: tweaking inlet and outlet blade numbers, angles and heights [within constraints] to minimise inlet blockage factor and outflow misalignment.</li><br/>

											</div>

										<li>I then 3D modelled the analytically best variations, utilising computational fluid dynamics simulations in ANSYS Fluent to compare their performances. Given the Nylon 3D printing material, tolerances of ±0.3mm were factored into the models along with casing clearance of 0.1mm.</li><br/>

										<li>In selecting the material for the full-size impeller; PW100 datasheets contained operating rpms, take-off and working temperature ranges that the impeller would experience, providing required melting point and corrosion-resistance metrics.</li><br/>
										<li>Materials with further favourable indices such as (stiffness, fracture toughness, yield strength and fatigue strength) / density were filtered for and evaluated in CES Edupack</li><br/>

										<li>The final eight materials were evaluated in a decision matrix regarding carbon footprints and emissions, leading to AISI 302 Stainless Steel HT grade D as the selection.</li><br/>
										
										<li>In selecting the manufacturing process: the volume of the real PW100 impeller was interpolated from datasheets and compared to the prototype impeller, determining a scaling ratio of 714.</li><br/>
										
										<li>This estimated the PW100 impeller mass at 75kg, with upper-bound tolerances of 1mm. An economic batch size range of 370±185 was inferred from PW100 sales figures, and minimum material utilisation fraction was set to 0.75-0.85.</li><br/>
										
										<li>These manufacturing restrictions were applied to CES, and the three remaining processes were evaluated in a decision matrix to arrive at ceramic mold casting as the most enviromentally friendly manufacturing process for the steel impeller.</li>

									</ul>

									<h3>Results</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The impeller design was refined with group members through decision matrices, to arrive at the final 6-blade design:</li><br/>

											</div>
										</div>

										<li>It was then 3D printed and tested: exhibiting an efficiency of 29.71%. This scored in the top half of the cohort whilst having a lower blade number of 6, delivering an appealing blend of reliability and performance. </li><br/>

										</div>
										
										<li>Life Cycle Analysis carried out on CES Eco Audit showed the material + manufacturing footprints of the impeller to only sum to 0.5% of total engine operation footprint. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the component is able to be recycled infinitely.</li><br/>

										<li>The final presentation was very well received by the panel, and the project received a high first-class [79%].</li>
